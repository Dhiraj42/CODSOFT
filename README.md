# Codsoft Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Codsoft Internship batch of July and August! In this repository, you will find my completed Jupyter Notebook projects for the five tasks assigned during the internship period. Each project is related to data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling using Python. Below is a brief overview of each task:

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

In this project, I have worked on the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc. I have implemented machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance to determine the best model for survival prediction.

## Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

For this task, I have utilized a movie dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts movie ratings based on features like genre, cast, director, etc. I have preprocessed the data, performed exploratory data analysis, and trained a regression model to estimate movie ratings.

## Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

The Iris Flower dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning. In this project, I have applied various classification algorithms to predict the species of iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. I have also visualized the data to gain insights into the distribution of different species.

## Task 4: Sales Prediction using Python

For this project, I worked on a sales dataset to build a predictive model that forecasts future sales. I have applied time series analysis techniques and developed a sales prediction model to assist in business decision-making.

## Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this task, I have worked on a credit card transaction dataset to detect fraudulent transactions. I have employed machine learning techniques to build an effective fraud detection model, which is crucial for financial security.

Each project's Jupyter Notebook, along with any necessary datasets and files, can be found in their respective directories within this repository. Feel free to explore the code, data, and results to understand the process and findings.

Please note that the repository is organized as follows:

- `Task1_Titanic_Survival_Prediction/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook and related files for the Titanic Survival Prediction project.
- `Task2_Movie_Rating_Prediction/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook and related files for the Movie Rating Prediction project.
- `Task3_Iris_Flower_Classification/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook and related files for the Iris Flower Classification project.
- `Task4_Sales_Prediction/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook and related files for the Sales Prediction project.
- `Task5_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook and related files for the Credit Card Fraud Detection project.
